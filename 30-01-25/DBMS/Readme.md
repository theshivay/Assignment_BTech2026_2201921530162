## Approach

### SQL Query Approach
**Algorithm:**
1. Compare each row with another row in the same table.
2. Identify duplicate emails where `id` is greater for one entry.
3. Delete the duplicate entry while keeping the one with the smallest `id`.

**Code:**
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
delete p1 
from Person p1, Person p2 
where p1.id > p2.id and p1.email=p2.email;
```

**Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²) (Self-join comparison for duplicate entries)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) (No extra space used)
