# Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming

## Definition
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities. It helps in reducing code complexity and increasing reusability by defining clear and concise interfaces.

## Real-World Industry Example
**Automobile Industry - Car Manufacturing**

In the automobile industry, abstraction is used extensively in the design of vehicles. A driver interacts with a car using a steering wheel, accelerator, and brake, without knowing the intricate internal mechanisms of how the engine works, fuel combustion occurs, or how braking force is applied.

Similarly, in software development, abstraction allows users to work with high-level modules without needing to understand their internal complexities.

## Implementation in C++
### Example: Car System
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Abstract class
class Car {
public:
    virtual void startEngine() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
    virtual void stopEngine() = 0;   // Pure virtual function
};

// Concrete class
class Tesla : public Car {
public:
    void startEngine() override {
        cout << "Tesla's electric engine started!" << endl;
    }
    void stopEngine() override {
        cout << "Tesla's engine stopped!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car* myCar = new Tesla();
    myCar->startEngine();
    myCar->stopEngine();
    delete myCar;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
- The `Car` class is an **abstract class** that defines the structure but does not provide implementation.
- The `Tesla` class **inherits** from `Car` and implements its abstract methods.
- The user interacts with the `Car` class but does not need to know how the engine functions internally.

## Benefits of Abstraction
- **Simplifies complex systems** by providing clear interfaces.
- **Enhances maintainability** as implementation details can change without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Encourages modular design** by separating interface from implementation.

By using abstraction, industries can build scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems that align with real-world applications.
